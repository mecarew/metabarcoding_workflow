MEL: I've removed a lot of past workings here, as the checks are looking pretty complete.  Having said that, there are a few new discrepancies resulting from

# So, is it possible that the 126 genbank and private library matches were not appropriate at the species level?

# If you are happy to let them go, then I think we can say that the asv_library file is now complete and correct, 
#  EXCEPT FOR:
# A. rows where aqu = 0 (i.e. non-aquatic/non-macroinvertebrates). IDs are likely to be unreliable here
#    Certainly there are many cases of multiple "aqu = 0" names given to the same bin-uri.
#    These will take a lot of work to correct.
# B. Consider my recommended removal of the records with max_p_identity <= 86.2: see
#    L1204 in Appendix_2_clean_cw and L504-521 in compilation_of_osf_files.R for my reasoning
#    Note that (for aqu = 1 records only), these are identified by "dubious_id" = 1
#    There are only 51 such records

# Everything else from here on has been agreed as ok previously.

# Groups MEL has lumped that the script identified as distinct CHRIS3: If you found no overlap, I am happy to go with your assessment. As I mentioned above Notalina sp. B-ABV8023 had some matching specimens identified as Notalina bifara. This was my reason for combining them

x4 <- x[x$checked_species_name %in% mel_changes,]
# Remove these to get 
x <- x[!x$species %in% x4$species,]
nrow(x)
x
# reduced to 15, # MEL: you might want to do a final re-check of x
# CHRIS3: Happy with the final names for the final 15!


# MEL: 2 Notalina disagreements. These are presumably 2 records that fell through the buggy BOLD net again.
#      I am now sure that Notalina sp. B-ABV8023 is different from Notalina bifara
#      (See the checking code at L1119 in Appendix_2_clean_cw)
#      So, I am sure these two are correct (if your reported match to bold is correct)
