CHRIS: This code (below) uses my 'checked' sheets produced by using R (for compiling the bold v5 search data) and Excel for the manual follow up. Data was flagged where either the  bold v5 produced a match that was different to the current max_p_identity (changing whether a species identification was made i.e., => or <= 97 or was improved in bold v5) and/or the name current species name and bold name did not match. This process also pick error by me, those in the vsearch database and new squence data providing new species identifications.
MEL: I have adapted your code for checking against the final tfill table.  Note this doesn't check non-aqu/non-terrestrial records. CHRIS: That's fine. I saw your note in the previous qmd.

### I have several thoughts. Please respond to each below: 
###  1. I see checked_species_name is either blank or a genus/family/phylum name if bold_match is low.
###     Am I right in thinking that such records should just be removed from the library and let vsearch take care of identifying these? CHRIS: In vsearch these records do not have the most up to date taxonomic information or match or the max-identity is different. I have flag these because I would like to update the vsearch results with the most upto date taxonomic information (this could be coded by using the bold search results to include genus/family/phylum names). Other cases there is more taxonomy provided a genus name with a match <95. In these situations notebook 6 will adjust the taxonomy.
###     If I am not right, please explain your rationale for keeping them. CHRIS: I am overriding VSEARCH here as these records are error in the asv library. Below I have provided the bold search results from the exhaustive search for in 'bold_results_90' and below 'bold_results_90_2' This should provide the matches from the searches for the record from 92-93. I'd rather correct these via the asv library in case they are wrong in the vsearch results
bold_results_90_2 <- read.csv("~/uomShare/wergStaff/MelCarew/git-data/metabarcoding_workflow/asv_library/bold_search_to 90_2.csv")

###  2. I haven't yet adjusted the max_p_identity for records that you have manually set to <94, CHRIS: Can I suggest we search these record using the 'genus and species search' this will provide matched to 90 MEL: that sounds reasonable please do this. CHRIS see above
###     pending confirmation that you really want to include such records in the library. If I do so, the species names currently there will 
###     disappear (and only family value will be retained) CHRIS: Only family names will be retain if the match is between >92-<95 when I notebook 6
###  3. I haven't yet kept names from your private library (or GenBank). I propose that we assemble a small table of these records as a source CHRIS: That's fine. eventually these will end up on bold and the list can be updated when this happens. 
###     file for the script, but I wanted to check some details with you first. 

genei_bold_ck_priv_lib <- read.csv("~/uomShare/wergStaff/MelCarew/git-data/metabarcoding_workflow/asv_library/geneious_search_bold_ck_priv_lib.csv")
genei_sp_results2 <- genei_bold_ck_priv_lib %>%
  mutate(
    priv_lib_species = sapply(strsplit(Name, ";"), function(x) x[7]),
    priv_lib_species = gsub("_", " ", priv_lib_species),
    pairwise_identity = as.numeric(gsub("%", "", pairwise_identity))  # remove % and convert to number
  ) %>%
  filter(pairwise_identity >= 97) # 20 species with >= matches to my private database

gb_asv_matches2 <- gb_search_results2 %>%
  filter(match >= 97) %>%
  select(asv_code) %>%
  distinct(asv_code) # 16 asvs with >=97 match on genbank

###     a) Did you really check the identity of every sequence? (e.g. all 30 asv_codes called "Apsectrotanypus sp. MC-4"). If not, shouldn't your 
###     private library (and the asv_library) only include those your have checked and let your notebook 6 process decide which sequences are adequately similar
###     to be given the same name? CHRIS: I have coded this all now, so you can see the search results against the private library and genbank. I am not confident that Contacyphon lindensis in the 'check_no_bold' will return the correct result via vsearch so can we include it in the asv libray with this name correct assignment (as per genbank update).
###     b) related to this, some records have checked_species_name of records marked as private library, 
###       but are not commented as being in the private library (e.g
check_no_bold[check_no_bold$checked_species_name == "Pontogeneiidae sp. 0",]
###       Should these records be in either the asv or private library, as I asked in a)
###     c) Can you provide a source/justification for each id (how was the ID arrived at?) for inclusion in the private library table? CHRIS: Yes. please see 'genei_sp_results and 'genei_sp_results2'
###     d) 5 of your private library names have B- names, where they don't match BOLD >97%. CHRIS: I am hoping the Geneious output will help you here 
unique(check_no_bold$checked_species_name[grepl("B-", check_no_bold$checked_species_name) & grepl("private",check_no_bold$comments)]) #CHRIS: I have addressed this above see df 'genei_sp_results_bin'
###        Even though most of these have similarity to the given bin_uri close to 97%, I don't think 
###        this is a good idea, as when you submit them to BOLD they will be given new bin_uris, and the bins  
###        you have matched them to, may or may not overlap.  I think you should re-name them MC-something. CHRIS: You'll see in most case by looking at the private library DNA barcode bold search (priv_bar_lib) followed by the asvs searched against the library that they group. If you disgree please let me now with groupings you do thinkare justified.
###  4. I started flagging with species_name_shared_with_records_that_DO_match_BOLD = 1, are a particular problem
###     But these have now all gone away with your last BOLD rechecks, which is pleasing
x <- check_no_bold[check_no_bold$species_name_shared_with_records_that_DO_match_BOLD == 1 & check_no_bold$checked_species_name != "",]
nrow(x)
###   3. If you sort by bold_match descending, you'll see the first 12 records have bold_match > max_sim_bold. I have assumed 
###      checekd_species_name is wrong for these and have removed the species name (retaining the correct higher taxon names) # CHRIS: That is correct. I should have left the checked species name blank

no_check_no_bold
###  MEL: just 11 records that you haven't checked and do not have a bold match >97.  Are you happy with these 11? 
###       The last one is suss, given there are records in tfill that have been given this species name and do have matches to BOLD
# CHIRS: Sciomyzidae sp. MC-2 is from my private library (so vsearch is correct in this assignment). The remainder look like boarderline differences where  vsearch puts them just over 97
# MEL: Yes, but what about the last one??  I think this is highly suss. CHRIS: You are correct it should not have been given a bin (see above Trombidioidea sp. MC-1 ) As for the others Sciomyzidae sp. MC-2 (shows a match in genei_results) as for Trombidiformes sp. B-AEI1887 and Tasmanocoenis sp. B-ACG1634 I can't support this the match from bold should be used. The remainder are boarderline. Happy to leave them. I am not too fussed.

Some are a little more difficult to get your head around: e.g. Cricotopus sp. B-ACQ6787, which your comment says is not Cricotopus parbicinctus, has been called Cricotopus parbicinctus because ACQ6787 overlaps with ACG9186 and ACV9554, which are that species. CHRIS: If you say it overlaps, then it overlaps so change it (based this one checks of a few sequences on bold. Most other discrepancies are groupings. I trust your analysis here, over my looking on bold.
# Remove these to get 
x <- x[!x$species %in% x4$species,]
nrow(x) # reduced to 15, A relatively modest number for you to consider. If any are just a matter of correcting the name associated with a bin_uri, please just add lines to the bold_name_corrections object at L972 in Appendix_2_clean_cw.qmd (checking that the bin_uri isn't already in the list)
# CHRIS: All good except Contacyphon sp. B-AGN0208 should be updated to Nothocyphon serratipenis (Genbank name update), for Mirawara sp. AV1 I think we should use the bin name Mirawara sp. B-AAV0800,  sp. B-AFU5450 should be Caloca sp. B-AFU5450, Micronecta sp. B-SPAA886-23 is Proteobacteria.
